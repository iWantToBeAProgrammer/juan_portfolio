I worked as a frontend developer, implementing a visually rich UI with gradients, shadows, and decorative elements. The form submission was handled via API and exported directly to Excel, without using a database. A unique challenge was rendering complex content boxes, which we solved using PNG assets instead of coding them from scratch.",
